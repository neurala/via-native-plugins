# This CMake target will build a dummy plugin with basic input/outputs
# that also supports automatic discovery.
# To enable automatic camera discovery, the registered CameraDiscoverer class
# should have the name of the plugin (without extension) followed by "Discoverer"
# e.g. dummyPlugin.dll -> dummyPluginDiscoverer
